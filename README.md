This is the *Dog Glossary* project I made myself.

In this project, I managed to successfully implement:
- Fetch a random dog picture and display it on the page.
- Fetch the requested dog breed and show the image on the page.
- Fetch the requested sub-breeds and display them as a list on the page.
- Fetch all of the dog breeds with sub-breeds and show them on the page as a list.
- Add some CSS and style the page
